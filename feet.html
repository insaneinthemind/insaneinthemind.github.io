	<pAlthough the popularity of devices like smartwatches and fitness trackers have seen the term become a twenty-first-century buzz phrase,<br>
	wearable technology has actually been around for quite a while. <br>
	For example, innovations such as wristwatches and hearing aids were invented well over a century ago and heart rate monitors have been available since the early 1980s.></p>

	<p>The function is reminiscent of the self-lacing Nike Air MAG sneakers worn by actor Michael J Fox in 1989 movie Back to the Future II. <br>
		Nike unveiled the first working pair of the trainers last year, with a video showing Fox testing out their "power laces" function.</p>
